# Intrinsically memorable words have unique associations with their meanings

What makes a word memorable? We collected word recognition accuracy for n=2,109 (Experiment 1) and n=2,165 (Experiment 2) words from more than 600 participants in each experiment. This repository makes the memorability data publicly available and provides code to investigate which features are predictive of memorability.

## Environment
The environment does not require any sophisticated packages and would run in any Python 3 environment with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). However, to use the exact Python 3.8.13 environment used in the paper, install it as:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
